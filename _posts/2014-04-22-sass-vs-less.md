Was reading sass vs less on [css-tricks](http://css-tricks.com/sass-vs-less/). It really felt like compass gave sass an edge on the battle. A few days ago bootstrap also released a ported version of sass which is quite nice.


Kinda of off-topic, but I found [codewars](http://www.codewars.com/]) to be pretty interesting. Interactive code challenges, differ itself from the more "tradition" way of coding. I wonder is lessons like these will one day be implemented as classroom work? Hopefully one day it will happen.
